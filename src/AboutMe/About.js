    I am a full-stack React Native developer with recent experience building applications which run natively on web and
mobile platforms. I went to school at the University of Arizona where I pursued a Ph.D. in applied mathematics. In a few
years, my goal is to become a senior developer in React Native so that I can help others.
During my time at Revature, I've worked on several projects where I gained experience in both backend technologies
(including TypeScript, SQL, DynamoDB, EC2, ECS, and API gateways and AWS lambda) as well as frontend development
(including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, and React Native). I also have experience with DevOps and using CI/CD
pipelines, deploying to the AWS cloud. I also liked collaborative team environments where we all share our knowledge in
developing software. I look forward to applying all of my skills and prior experience in a position on your team.
