    I am a full-stack developer with experiences on building responsive web applications using React and Redux. 
    I went to school at the University of Arizona where I pursued a Ph.D. in applied mathematics. 
    My goal is to become a senior full-stack developer in a few years.
    At Revature, I had worked on several projects where I gained experiences 
    in both backend technologies (TypeScript, PostgresSQL, DynamoDB, AWS lambda) 
    and frontend development (React, Redux, React Native). 
 I would like to have an opportunity to work with your team and grow as a Software Engineer.
